## Rwazi Note App
Please design a user-friendly, single-page note-taking application using Laravel and Blade components. The application should allow users to easily add and remove notes, and the notes should be displayed on the main page in a responsive format. 
Please watch this video to get an idea of what it might look like.

The following requirements should be met:
- The layout of the application must be responsive to ensure optimal user experience.
- Users should be able to seamlessly add notes to the application.
- The application should allow users to effortlessly remove notes when necessary.
- The user should be able to sort by date the notes were created.
- The user should be able to search for text within the notes.
- If the number of notes is high, pagination should be implemented using Laravel's built-in
pagination.
- To add an element of visual interest, the background of the application should be
randomly generated.
- Finally, each note element should feature a date stamp at the bottom to help users keep
track of when they made each note.
- Please ensure that you use Laravel and Blade components when building the
application.
